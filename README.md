# AdventureGame
All sprites belong to Nintendo.
Incomplete project use w,a,s,d to move and hit space bar to use your sword that enemy on the start screen is killable and the tile in the bottom right of the initial room with change the map other than that it has a bunch of random sprites placed outside for testing purposes.
The game generates maps based off rgb inputs from a customized image I created.
The code from this game mostly comes from a tutorial but I adjusted it to fit my own needs such as adding my own enemies, the sword and changing the game from a side scroller to a top down.
Some of the files are remnants from when it was a side scroller such as the bullet object.
